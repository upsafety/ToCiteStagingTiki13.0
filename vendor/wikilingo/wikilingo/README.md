wikiLingo is a fun and exciting new programming language that you DON'T HAVE TO LEARN!  It's fully WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) driven, for a complete visual web experience.  It has a powerful plugin architecture for implementing whatever functionality you want into your website.  It is not like anything you've seen before, NO REALLY!
